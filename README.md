# Dungeons of Doom

## A Roguelike in Scala

You awaken in a damp cavern, slightly disoriented.
You feel a sharp pain on the back of your skull, as if someone had struck you on the head.

You get up and look around. Dim torches illuminate your surroundings and cast oddly shaped shadows on the wall. You see your Equipment scattered around on the floor next to you.

You ready yourself to stand up and plan how to escape this dungeon you were thrown into. Little did you know, that around every corner, creeping in the shadows, lies your Doom.

Tell me, Traveller, how will you escape your fate?  
How will you escape the ***Dungeons Of Doom***?

## Introduction

This Roguelike, written quite cheesy, is a university project for our course in software engineering.

It will be written in Scala and it (*tries to*) conform to the MVC-layer architecture.

## Installation
***WIP***
